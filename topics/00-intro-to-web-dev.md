# Introduction to Web Development

## What is Web Development

Basically, it is the science and art of creating websites. From the simplest contact form all the way to the most advanced online web app, all these are product of web development.


## How the Modern Internet Works

1. It all starts with a `browser`. Browsers are the default tool we use to browser the internet.

2. We tell the browser where we want to go using a `Uniform Resource Locator` (URL). We are most familiar with a format that looks like `https://google.com`.

3. The browser translates this URL into an `IP address` and then contacts the server at that address.

4. Often, the response is an `HTML` file.

5. The browser looks at the HTML file and requests additional files from the server. These could be images, stylesheets (`CSS`), and JavaScript files (`JS`).

6. As the user interacts with the page, additional requests are sent from the browser to the server.

## Frontend vs Backend

Everything we see in a website is called the `frontend`. The texts, the images, the buttons, all these are for the human user of a website.

The `backend`, on the other hand, is the part almost always invisible to the user. These are the parts that handle, process, and secure data.

Imagine the website as a restaurant. The storefront window, the interior design, the cutlery, and the staff are what we generally see and interact with. This is similar to the frontend.

The kitchen, usually hidden from view, is the backend. This is where the food is prepared before being served.

## Frontend vs Backend vs Fullstack Developer

Frontend developers are focused on making websites beautiful, fast, and responsive.

Backend developers are focused on making sure that the data is handled correctly.

Fullstack developers are a combination of the two. Most usually have a preference between frontend and backend but they can handle both.
